  <h1>SOS I'm very confused</h1>
  <p>I'm really confused about the API code with how to conjoin it to appear on the site page & connect to the actual search box on the site.</p>
  <p>Here is my unique API : https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=summer&api-key=MZ7AJiGIKIrgVSGsLi8BlNr7w26OOVzB</p>
  <p>Also, certain things weren't working on my API - I originally wanted to use the movie API, but nothing would appear even switching which keywords to use since they weren't the same as the article API</p>
  <div>
    Searh a keyword to find a news article:</br>
    <input type = "text" name = "news"></br>
    <button type="button">Search</button>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
